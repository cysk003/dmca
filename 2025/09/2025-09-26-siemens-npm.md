**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work at issue is Teamcenter Active Workspace, a proprietary web-based client of Siemens’ Teamcenter product lifecycle management software. This software is not open source and is distributed only to licensed Siemens customers and system integrators under strict contractual agreements.

The code published in the packages below includes proprietary Siemens source code and related materials that are distributed exclusively to licensed users under Siemens’ copyright. Publication on npm makes this code publicly available without authorization. Siemens has not authorized this code to be publicly shared, redistributed, or published on npm. The release circumvents Siemens’ controlled distribution process and poses risks of misuse by third parties. The use of the package name “active-workspace” is a direct reference to Siemens’ Teamcenter Active Workspace product and constitutes unauthorized use of Siemens’ trademark.
