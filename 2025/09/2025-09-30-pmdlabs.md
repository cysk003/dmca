Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the the [private] of PMDLabs Inc. DBA Private MD Labs (https://www.privatemdlabs.com). Private MD Labs is the sole copyright owner of the proprietary source code in question. I am authorized to act on behalf of the company in this matter.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is the complete source code for our company's proprietary, private software application, which serves as our e-commerce platform. This is a closed-source Laravel application developed internally by our employees for the sole commercial use of Private MD Labs.

All employees and contractors who have ever been granted access to this source code are bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which explicitly prohibits the unauthorized disclosure, distribution, or publication of the company's intellectual property and trade secrets. The code is not, and has never been, intended for public distribution or licensed under any open-source license. The public posting is a direct violation of our copyright and the contractual agreements in place to protect it.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original copyrighted work is hosted in our private [private] repository, which is not accessible to the public:  
[private]

The leaked code matches this commit from July 2023, and overall it appears to be from 7/31/2023 - 8/7/2023:  
[private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/erymaz/Private-MD-Labs

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original source code is hosted in a private [private] repository, and access is strictly controlled and limited to authorized company employees via user accounts and credentials. This access is immediately revoked upon termination of employment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This question concerning anti-circumvention technology is not directly applicable to this specific case. The accused project is not a tool, software, or device designed to circumvent a technological measure.

Instead, the infringing repository is a direct, unauthorized copy and public distribution of our proprietary source code. Our technological protection measure is that the original copyrighted work is stored in a private, access-controlled [private] repository, which is not accessible to the public.

The individual who posted this public repository was a former employee who had authorized access during their employment. They have published the code after their employment ended, in direct violation of copyright law and the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) they signed. Therefore, this is a matter of direct copyright infringement (unauthorized reproduction and publication), not the creation of a circumvention tool.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The code was posted by the GitHub user https://github.com/erymaz. We believe this is a former employee, although at this moment we haven't been able to identify them yet. We request that GitHub proceeds with the takedown based on the clear copyright infringement.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
