**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the “namefix.pl” project, first released in 2006 on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/namefix/

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The repository claims “Copyright (C) 2023 sukulent” and GPL-3-or-later, but removes attribution to the original author ([private]) and namefix.pl (2006). It fails to preserve copyright notices or acknowledge derivation, instead presenting the work as wholly original. This violates GPL requirements to retain notices and credit provenance.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Correct all source file headers to include attribution to [private] and namefix.pl (2006).

Add a clear statement in the README and documentation that the project derives from the original, with links to the SourceForge and GitHub repositories.

Prominently credit the original author in release notes and man pages.

Rename the repository and AUR package to avoid namespace hijack (e.g., namefix-cpp) and clearly distinguish it from the original.

Ensure all downstream distributions and packages preserve the above attribution and GPL licensing.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
