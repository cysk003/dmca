Dear GitHub staff,

My name is [private] and I am the [private] of client IO s.r.o. A web page that your company hosts is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.

Our proprietary software package JointJS+ has been copied and published on your servers without permission. The original copyrighted work to which we own the exclusive rights can be found at:

https://www.jointjs.com/jointjs-plus

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/joint-plus

The npm user who published this package has uploaded our proprietary source code, which is distributed only under a commercial license to paying customers, and is never authorized for public redistribution. This action circumvents our technological access restrictions and exposes our proprietary software package publicly without authorization.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately remove the content from your servers and notify the infringer of this notice, inform them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me, please contact me directly.

Thank you.
