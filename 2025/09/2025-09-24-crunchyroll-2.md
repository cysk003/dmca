We, MarkScan, have been duly authorized by Crunchyroll, LLC to issue this notice to you under the provisions of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, and the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA), a part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (DMCA). Service providers are strictly liable for the acts of their users and are required to cease access to infringing material immediately upon being notified of such infringement.

Crunchyroll, LLC is the owner of certain rights to a vast catalog of copyright-protected works, hereafter referred to as “Protected Work(s).” A representative list of these Protected Work(s) has been included as Appendix A.

This notice is to bring to your attention that we have found copyright infringement on the application named “Sora” that is using your services. The repositories listed below contain source code, modules, and precompiled binaries (e.g., Sora.ipa) that are specifically designed to circumvent access controls and enable unauthorized access to Crunchyroll-licensed anime content. By facilitating the reproduction, distribution, and unauthorized public performance of Crunchyroll’s works, these repositories infringe Crunchyroll’s copyright.

We assert that the entirety of the repositories listed in Section I of Appendix B are infringing. Additionally, we have identified specific infringing files/releases in Section II of Appendix B.

We have a good faith belief that the use of the Protected Work(s) owned and/or controlled by our client in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owners, their agents, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

We hereby request you immediately remove and/or disable access to the infringing material(s) from your service in accordance with the law and GitHub’s Unauthorized Copyright Access Policy:
