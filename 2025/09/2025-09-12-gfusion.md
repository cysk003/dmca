I was going about my business in my day to see if anybody has been discussing [private] project online within [private] for [private] repository GFusion here [GFusion](https://github.com/Cr0mb/CS2-GFusion-Python). Where I searched on [private] "cs2 gfusion python cheat" and the first of items to pop up was a video by someone [private] do not know as well as a github repository linked below it in the description [private]. On this GitHub repository linked [here](https://github.com/HANNIBAL-THO/THO-GFUSION-CS2) it gives [private] full source code to [private] project with some changes made to it. While it clearly states, and has stated a copyright license within the project's real repository [here](https://github.com/Cr0mb/CS2-GFusion-Python?tab=License-1-ov-file). Here it explicitly states "To request permission for modification, contact the author on [private]: [private]

Unauthorized modification, reverse engineering, or redistribution of modified versions is strictly prohibited."

I can confirm this is a form of infringement because [private] did not allow them to post, modify, or reverse engineer [private] work.  
I wish to please have this repository taken down or for repercussive action to take place.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Most if not all links and information for both media and history has been recorded within the GitHub repo.
