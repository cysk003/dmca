Dear GitHub Legal,

I am the copyright owner/authorized agent for the software identified below and submit this DMCA takedown notice:

1) Copyrighted Work Claimed

Title: PromptCraft

Original repo: https://github.com/quasar2333/promptcraft (licensed under GPL-3.0)

Author attribution: Ultimate_Kevin ([private]).

The project is released under GPLv3, which requires preserving notices and, when distributing object code (e.g., JAR), providing the Corresponding Source to the public.

2) Infringing Material and Location

Repo: https://github.com/Shylz-q/Prompt_Craft

Releases (binary distribution): https://github.com/Shylz-q/Prompt_Craft/releases (e.g., “Prompt_Craft_1.0.4” with assets).

This repository distributes object code derived from [private] work without preserving copyright/license notices and without providing the Corresponding Source, violating GPLv3 §§4/5/6. Absent compliance, the license terminates under §8, rendering the distribution unauthorized and infringing. Attempts to contact the user were refused.

3) Remedy Requested (for GitHub to relay to the user)  
Unless the owner immediately:  
(i) removes all infringing content and binaries; or  
(ii) fully cures GPLv3 non-compliance by restoring attribution and license notices, licensing the entire derivative under GPLv3, and providing complete, publicly accessible Corresponding Source for each binary release,

please disable the repository and its releases.
