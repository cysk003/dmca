Re: DMCA Notice / Circumvention of Technological Measures - https://github.com/rhunk/ScpPatcher

 

Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,

 

Our firm represents Snap Inc. (“Snap”) in intellectual property matters. Snap is the owner of the copyright in the Snapchat software, application programming interface (“API”) and technology. See, e.g., https://www.snapchat.com/; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android.

 

Please consider this formal service of a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice. I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

It has come to our attention that the reported URL distributes software that modifies Snapchat to unlock Snapchat+, Snap’s paid subscription service offering premium features, in an unauthorized manner.

 

We thus have a good faith belief that reported content is unlawful because it circumvents a technological measure that prevents unauthorized access to a copyrighted work. See 17 U.S.C. § 1201.

 

The infringement occurs at: https://github.com/rhunk/ScpPatcher

 

We respectfully request removal of the reported URL.

 

I may be contacted via the contact information in the signature block below.

 

The GitHub username associated with the allegedly infringing content is rhunk. The user’s contact information is unknown.

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

Thank you for your attention to this notice.

 

Sincerely,

/s/ [private]
