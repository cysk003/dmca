Hello GitHub Trust & Safety Team,

I am submitting this revised DMCA takedown notice as requested.

Copyright Ownership  
I, [private], am the copyright holder of the original work. [private] original project is a Telegram music bot named ShrutiMusic, which [private] published under the MIT open-source license.  
Here is the link to [private] original repository:  
https://github.com/NoxxOP/ShrutiMusic

How the reported repositories violate the license  
While [private] project is under the MIT license, the reported repositories have removed [private] name, credits, and original references. They have replaced [private] identity with theirs, modified my original code, and continued to distribute it under [private] license terms without proper attribution.  
This removal of credits and author identity is a direct violation of the MIT license conditions which explicitly require that the copyright notice and permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

Examples of infringing modifications:

They removed [private] ID and references in multiple files (e.g., sudoers.py, dev.py, userbot.py).  
[private] original groups, channels, and identifiers were deleted or replaced with their own.  
They continue to use and distribute [private] code while presenting it as entirely their own.  
Original Work Reference  
[private] original repository:

Infringing Repositories  
The following repositories are infringing and should be removed:

https://github.com/mukeshmoni/AnanyaMusic  
https://github.com/khanduudon/AnanyaMusic  
Specific infringing files include (but are not limited to):

https://github.com/mukeshmoni/AnanyaMusic/blob/main/ShrutiMusic/plugins/sudo/sudoers.py  
https://github.com/mukeshmoni/AnanyaMusic/blob/main/ShrutiMusic/plugins/tools/dev.py  
https://github.com/mukeshmoni/AnanyaMusic/blob/main/ShrutiMusic/core/userbot.py  
Since the same violations occur across these repositories, I confirm that the entire repositories are infringing.
