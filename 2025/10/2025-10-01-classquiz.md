Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the source code in question. The code was first published in [private] GitHub repository under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) with proper copyright notices identifying me as the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work consists of the source code files that [private] authored and published in [private] GitHub repository. Each file in [private] repository contains SPDX headers specifying:

SPDX-FileCopyrightText: [private]  
SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0

This indicates that [private] am the copyright holder and that the code is licensed under MPL-2.0.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/pi3roo/fermiquiz

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mozilla-public-license-2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The MPL-2.0 requires preservation of existing copyright notices in all copies and derivative works. The infringing repository has removed [private] copyright notice from every file and replaced it with another person’s name. This violates both copyright law and Section 3.4 of the MPL-2.0, which requires retention of [private] attribution.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The repository can be brought into compliance if the original copyright notice is restored in every file. The fork’s author may add their own copyright notice for their contributions, but they must not remove [private]. The license identifier (MPL-2.0) must also be preserved.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
