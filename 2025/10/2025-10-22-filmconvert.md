**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized representative of Rubber Monkey Software, the copyright owner of the software products FilmConvert Nitrate, FilmConvert Halation, and related digital assets. Rubber Monkey Software owns all rights to the code, plugins, trademarks, and brand content distributed under the FilmConvert name. I am authorized to submit this takedown notice on behalf of the company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted works are the FilmConvert suite of software products developed and owned by Rubber Monkey Software, including FilmConvert Nitrate and FilmConvert Halation.

These products are professional film-emulation and color-grading plugins and applications used in video-editing software such as DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro. All source code, compiled binaries, brand assets, and documentation for these products are the exclusive property of Rubber Monkey Software.

The infringing GitHub accounts and repositories are using the FilmConvert name and product titles, and in some cases claim to distribute, modify, or provide ‚Äúcracked‚Äù versions of our software without authorization. This constitutes copyright infringement and brand impersonation.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original copyrighted software and related information are available on the official FilmConvert website:

üîó https://www.filmconvert.com

This is the only authorized source for FilmConvert, FilmConvert Nitrate, and FilmConvert Halation products developed and distributed by Rubber Monkey Software.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Rubber Monkey Software uses license key activation and online verification systems to control access to FilmConvert products.

Each FilmConvert installation requires a unique serial number that is validated through our licensing servers before the software can be activated. This process ensures only authorized users with purchased licenses can use the product.

Our installers are digitally signed and distributed exclusively through our official website (https://www.filmconvert.com
), which prevents tampering and unauthorized redistribution.

These technological measures effectively prevent unlicensed installations and control access to our copyrighted software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repositories are designed to circumvent Rubber Monkey Software‚Äôs technological protection measures by providing or facilitating access to modified installers, patched binaries, and instructions that remove or bypass our license-key activation and online verification systems.

Indicators of circumvention include repository names and README text that explicitly reference ‚Äúcrack,‚Äù ‚Äúdownload,‚Äù or ‚Äúinstaller‚Äù (for example: thomasleethjop34145/filmconvert-halation-crack and FilmConvert-Mac/FilmConvert-Nitrate-FCPX-App-Mac). These indicators and the repositories‚Äô stated purpose strongly suggest they are intended to:

distribute patched/modified binaries or installer packages in which license checks have been removed or altered so the software can run without valid activation;

provide patches/patchers, key-gens, or ‚Äúloaders‚Äù that bypass or neutralize the product‚Äôs activation routines;

host or link to pre-activated license files or stolen serials that can be dropped into installs to circumvent online verification; and/or

supply step-by-step instructions for replacing original files or altering configuration to disable activation and license enforcement.

These actions directly neutralize our access controls (unique serial/activation checks, server-side validation, and digitally signed installers), permitting unauthorized use of FilmConvert software and thereby circumventing the technological measures Rubber Monkey Software has put in place.
