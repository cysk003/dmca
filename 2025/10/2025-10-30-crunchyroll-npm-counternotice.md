To GitHub DMCA Agent,  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.  
  
This is a copy of an already submitted counter-notice in response to the DMCA takedown request submitted by [private] on behalf of Crunchyroll, LLC. The claims in the notice are factually incorrect as likely orignal was .

1. node-roku  
  
**Claim from DMCA notice:**    
`In node-roku, the repository contains files such as lib/device.js and lib/transport.js which reproduce functions and command structures taken directly from Crunchyroll’s proprietary Roku integration code.`  
  
**Rebuttal:**    
- The files `lib/device.js` and `lib/transport.js` have never existed in [private] repository or in any distributed npm packages.  
- node-roku is a TypeScript API client for Roku’s publicly documented APIs.  
- References: [Roku official documentation](https://developer.roku.com/es-cl/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/tools-overview.md), [private]

2. appium-roku-driver  
  
**Claim from DMCA notice:**    
`In appium-roku-driver, the lib/driver.js file contains routines and APIs that replicate Crunchyroll’s protected automation and playback testing modules.`  
  
**Rebuttal:**    
- The file `lib/driver.js` has never existed in [private] repository or in any distributed npm packages.  
- The driver implements only the standard Appium base driver interface and delegates to node-roku for issuing commands through Roku’s documented APIs.  
- It contains no playback functionality, proprietary modules, or Crunchyroll-related code.  
- References: [private], [private], [private], [private]

3. binary-decoder.js  
  
**Claim from DMCA notice:**    
`In binary-decoder.js, the repository reproduces Crunchyroll’s binary parsing logic, which is an internal utility owned by Crunchyroll.`  
  
**Rebuttal:**  
- Incorrect. This library was independently written by [private] from scratch as a small experimental project (≈100 LOC).  
- It explores an unconventional idea: using JavaScript generators to implement a binary reader, where yield values guide parsing logic.  
- The inspiration came from [private]’s open-source project [private] and presentations on generator-based flow control  
- The design and implementation are [private] own, and it is highly unlikely to match any proprietary code.

**Other repositories/packages**    
All other repositories and npm packages listed in the notice are independently authored projects based on public documentation and API specifications [private], [private], [private], [private]. None contain, replicate, or use any Crunchyroll code. Many of these packages have multiple independent implementations by other developers, demonstrating that these are widely used public APIs rather than proprietary material.

**Good Faith Statement, Jurisdiction, and Contact Information**    
  
I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification. None of [private] repositories or packages contain code copied or derived from Crunchyroll.  
  
I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California. I will accept service of process from the complainant or their agent.
