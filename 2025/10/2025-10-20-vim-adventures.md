Dear Copyright team,  
  
I'm submitting this request as a follow up to a previous request that was handled in the past, since new forks appeared again on GitHub.com.  
  
Name: [private]  
  
Email: [private]  
  
Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.  
I am the [private] of an online game VIM-Adventures (https://vim-adventures.com). Everything on that site is [private] creation and copyrighted to [private] and my company.  
  
Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.  
[private] own a website https://vim-adventures.com that [private] programmed and created. It's a paid for game. Someone paid for a license, and then uploaded to github all the minimized html, css, javascript files, graphics and data responses from the server for free. Even in the README he said that he doesn't own the copyright, that it's mine. The repository was created to serve [private] copyrighted material, and even package it as a docker image with github actions. The repository contains all that was stolen and replicates [private] work without paying for a license. [private] contacted the user and he removed the repository, but a lot of forks are still out there and need to be removed.  
  
What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.  
  
https://github.com/biglone/vim-adventures  
https://github.com/bad4iz/vim-adventures  
https://github.com/jobenaus/vim-adventures  
  
Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.  
All of the above and any that can be accesed via https://github.com/biglone/vim-adventures/network/members :  
https://github.com/biglone/vim-adventures  
https://github.com/bad4iz/vim-adventures  
https://github.com/jobenaus/vim-adventures  
  
Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?  
The work is copyrighted to [private] and my company.  
  
What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?  
No. The repository contains a copy of [private] code and data, all copyrighted material. It's sole purpose is to allow people access to [private] copyrighted material without paying for a license. The repositories should be removed completely, as this is theft.  
  
Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.  
The original infringer in 2020 was [private] ([private])  
He removed the repository by [private] request, but the other forks are still online and should now be deleted.  
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.  
  
So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.
