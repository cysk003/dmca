**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the software and related materials for Wembean, a free and paid Membean assistant extension published on the Chrome Web Store and managed through Wembean.com.

All source code, branding, user interface design, and written content were developed by me (or my team) and are owned exclusively by Wembean. No part of this work has been released under an open-source or permissive license.

As the [private] copyright owner, I have full legal authority to act on behalf of Wembean and to request the removal of unauthorized copies or reproductions of our product or its associated materials.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Wembean employs several technological measures to control access to premium content and protect our copyrighted software:  
1. License Validation: Premium features are accessible only to authenticated users with a valid subscription. Requests for premium functionality are checked against our secure server to confirm authorization.  
2. API Access Control: The extension communicates with Wembean’s API, which verifies user credentials and enforces usage limits, preventing unauthorized access or manipulation.  
3. Obfuscated Code: Certain critical portions of the extension’s code are obfuscated to make reverse-engineering or unauthorized replication more difficult.

These measures ensure that only authorized users can access premium features, and they prevent third parties from copying, distributing, or bypassing the protected functionality. The infringing repository circumvents these protections and reproduces premium features without permission, which constitutes a copyright violation.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repository modifies Wembean’s client code to bypass license validation and entitlement checks, allowing access to premium features without a valid subscription. It instructs users to load the extension as an unpacked Chrome extension, bypassing the Chrome Web Store’s signed distribution. The project also replicates API calls and functionality meant to be restricted, effectively circumventing Wembean’s technological protections.
