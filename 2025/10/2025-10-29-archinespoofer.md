Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the original Archine Spoofer software, including all code, assets, and materials. I did not authorize redistribution, modification, or reupload of this project.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the Archine Spoofer project, developed by [private]. It includes proprietary source code, scripts, and related materials for system spoofing functions. The infringing repository has copied and distributed my files without permission.  
The infringing repository not only redistributes my copyrighted software but also contains circumvention of my technological protection measures (KeyAuth and Themida). This unauthorized access and distribution directly violate 17 U.S.C. §1201

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://spoofer.archinespoofer.com

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/infiSTAR/Archine_Valorant_Spoofer

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original Archine Spoofer uses KeyAuth, a hardware-bound licensing and authentication system that verifies user credentials and license keys before allowing access to the software.  
It also uses [private], a commercial code-protection and virtualization tool, to encrypt and obfuscate the compiled binaries. [private] prevents reverse engineering, debugging, and tampering, effectively controlling access to the protected code and internal logic of the program.  
These two systems together ensure that only authorized, paying users can access and run the legitimate software, and that the binary cannot be easily decompiled or modified.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing repository (https://github.com/infiSTAR/Archine_Valorant_Spoofer) contains code and binaries that remove or bypass the KeyAuth authentication system, allowing the program to run without a valid license key.  
It also includes de-obfuscated or unpacked versions of my protected binaries, indicating that [private] protection has been stripped or bypassed, allowing unauthorized access to my proprietary code.  
These actions constitute circumvention of my technological protection measures under 17 U.S.C. § 1201, as they intentionally disable or remove access controls that I implemented to protect my copyrighted material.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No public contact information available beyond the GitHub username above.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
