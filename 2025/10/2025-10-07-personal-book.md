I am the [private] and copyright owner of the original writings that were published on [private] personal blog. These writings are part of a forthcoming book that [private] am preparing to publish.

[private] lost access to the GitHub accounts "xiungo" and "AnHoaiKhongLon" a long time ago because [private] forgot the passwords and also lost [private] old phone with two-factor authentication. Therefore, [private] cannot log back into these accounts or remove the infringing content [private].

I am submitting this DMCA notice to request that the infringing content be taken down. I am willing to resolve any dispute if necessary.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted works are my original blog writings and manuscripts, which [private] am preparing to publish as a book. The infringing sites reproduce my work without [private] authorization.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The alleged infringing accounts are my own old GitHub accounts:

GitHub username: xiungo  
GitHub username: AnHoaiKhongLon  
[private] lost access to both of these accounts a long time ago because [private] forgot the passwords and also lost [private] old phone used for two-factor authentication. As a result, [private] cannot log back in or remove the infringing content myself.

Please remove or disable access to the repositories and GitHub Pages sites under these accounts. I fully confirm that [private] am the sole copyright owner of the content, and there are no other rights holders. I understand that you may send a notification to those accounts, and I am willing to wait for that process, but I can assure you that no one else represents those accounts except [private].

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
