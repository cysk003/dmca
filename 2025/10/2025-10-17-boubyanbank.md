ORIGINAL COPYRIGHTED WORK:  
  
Boubyan Bank K.S.C.P. owns the exclusive copyright to proprietary mobile  
banking application source code, internal development tools, and associated  
technical documentation. This includes:  
  
1. **BbynScreenGeneratorPlugin**: A custom IntelliJ IDEA plugin developed  
internally by Boubyan Bank's software development team. "Bbyn" is Boubyan  
Bank's internal abbreviated identifier used exclusively within our  
organization. This plugin contains proprietary code generation templates,  
custom workflows, and Boubyan-specific architectural patterns.  
  
2. **Mobile Application Source Code**: Core business logic, user interface  
components, and functional modules for Boubyan Bank's mobile banking  
application used by our customers for financial transactions.  
  
3. **Internal Development Infrastructure**: Gradle build configurations,  
project structure, dependency management files, and compilation scripts  
that reflect our proprietary development methodology and technical  
architecture.  
  
4. **Code Generation Templates**: Custom templates containing Boubyan Bank's  
naming conventions, coding standards, architectural patterns, and business  
rule implementations specific to our banking operations.  
  
5. **Technical Documentation**: Comments, configuration files, and embedded  
documentation revealing our internal systems architecture and  
implementation details.  
  
All code was created by Boubyan Bank employees and contractors as work-for-hire  
under employment and consulting agreements, making Boubyan Bank the exclusive  
copyright holder. This code has never been released under any open-source  
license and was developed solely for internal use within our banking operations.

NATURE OF INFRINGEMENT:  
  
The reported repository contains unauthorized copies of the copyrighted  
materials described above. Specifically:  
  
**Unauthorized Publication**: A current or former employee/contractor has  
published Boubyan Bank's proprietary source code to a public GitHub repository  
without authorization, in direct violation of their employment agreement and  
our intellectual property rights.  
  
**Complete Codebase Exposure**: The repository includes substantial portions  
or the entirety of our internal development tools, revealing:  
- Proprietary plugin architecture (BbynScreenGeneratorPlugin)  
- Internal naming conventions and package structures (likely containing  
"com.boubyan.*" or similar Boubyan-specific namespaces)  
- Build configurations exposing our development environment  
- Code templates revealing our business logic patterns  
- Technical implementation details of our mobile banking application  
  
**Evidence of Boubyan Ownership**:  
- Plugin name explicitly references "Bbyn" (Boubyan's internal abbreviation)  
- Code structure matches our internal development standards  
- No open-source license present (confirming unauthorized publication)  
- Technical patterns consistent with our proprietary architecture  
- Repository was created by individual without authority to publish

- Reveals internal architecture of our mobile banking application  
- Exposes potential security vulnerabilities to malicious actors  
- Enables creation of fraudulent applications mimicking our services  
- Violates banking industry security regulations (PCI DSS compliance)  
- Threatens customer data protection and financial security  
- Provides competitive intelligence about our technical capabilities  
  
**Legal Violations**:  
- Infringes Boubyan Bank's copyright under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  
(DMCA) and international copyright law  
- Violates employee/contractor confidentiality agreements  
- Breaches intellectual property protections for financial institutions  
- Potentially violates Kuwaiti banking regulations and trade secret laws  
  
We have not authorized any individual or entity to publish this proprietary  
code. The repository owner had no legal right to distribute this copyrighted  
material and is in clear violation of our intellectual property rights.
