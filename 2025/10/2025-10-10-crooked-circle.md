**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized representative of Crooked Circle Press LLC, the sole owner of the copyrighted source code and related intellectual property for the Vrennly application.  
The developer who posted the infringing material was an independent contractor hired through [private] to perform work-for-hire development under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  
Under that agreement, all code, designs, and deliverables created for the Vrennly project are the exclusive property of Crooked Circle Press LLC.  
The contractor was terminated for breach of contract after sharing the code with an unauthorized third party. He is now publicly distributing portions of that code on GitHub without authorization, violating both our copyright ownership and the NDA.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is the proprietary source code and frontend design of the Vrennly application, a social friend-matching platform owned by Crooked Circle Press LLC.  
This code was developed under a work-for-hire and NDA agreement with an [private] contractor, granting full ownership of all deliverables and related intellectual property to Crooked Circle Press LLC.  
The infringing repository publicly reproduces and distributes our confidential front-end source files, structure, and proprietary interface logic without permission.
