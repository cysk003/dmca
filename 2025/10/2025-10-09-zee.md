Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,  
  
We refer to your recent response regarding our previous DMCA takedown notices submitted on behalf of our client, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (Rights Holder).  
  
We kindly request that you consider this as a newly revised and complete complaint, and please disregard the earlier versions previously submitted. This updated notice includes additional details and supporting evidence to clarify the nature of the infringement.  
  
Upon careful review, we would like to reiterate that the below-listed repositories and files contain or facilitate unauthorized access to Zee Entertainment’s copyrighted works. Specifically, these repositories include embedded and extracted streaming URLs (.m3u8 links) and related code that allows third parties to illegally access and publicly stream premium Zee5 content.  
  
These URLs are not publicly available on Zee5’s official platforms and have been extracted through unauthorized means. The repositories in question enable users to stream Zee5 content for free using third-party video players such as VLC and MX Player, thereby violating Zee Entertainment’s exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, 1957 (India) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512).  
  
For your review, we have attached a demonstration video that clearly shows how the reported repositories are being used to stream our client’s copyrighted content without authorization. This should provide better clarity on the infringement and the extent of misuse.  
  
Accordingly, we kindly request that you remove or disable access to the following infringing repositories and files hosted on GitHub:

Repository title and content explicitly misuse Zee5’s brand name and include code for unauthorized streaming access.
