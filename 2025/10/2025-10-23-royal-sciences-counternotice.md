Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I used to have [private] on my website, but I removed it when [private] asked me in my [private] server.  
Also no assets involving [private] were hosted in the repository that was taken down (https://github.com/gn-math/gn-math.github.io) and they were all hosted in a repository that was already wiped clean (commits included)

All assets in other repositories belonging to Royal Sciences were removed approximately 3-4 days before the DMCA takedown took place.
