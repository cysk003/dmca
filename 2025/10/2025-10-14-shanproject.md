Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Unauthorized Theft and Public Disclosure of Private GitHub Repository by Developer [private] (naganohara-yoshino)  
  
Dear GitHub Support Team,  
  
I am writing to report a serious case of intellectual property theft and unauthorized disclosure of a private [private] repository. But the repository in question, wrecked(https://github.com/naganohara-yoshino/wrecked.git), is the legitimate property of ShanProject, but has been illegally taken and made public by a former developer, [private] (naganohara-yoshino).  
  
Background and Ownership  
  
·The repository wrecked(https://github.com/naganohara-yoshino/wrecked.git) was developed as a private project owned and maintained by ShanProject  
· [private] (naganohara-yoshino) was granted limited developer access to assist with project development  
· This access was explicitly for internal use only, and did not include any rights to transfer, copy, or publicly disclose the repository  
  
The Violation  
  
On or around 2025/10/11, [private] (naganohara-yoshino):  
  
· Illegally transferred the repository to their personal GitHub account  
· Made the repository public without authorization  
· Refused to return access when confronted  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
"Wrecked" is a commercial visual novel game development project created by a small team. Most of the artwork, code, and music are either our original creations or free open-source content. A exploited his original developer privileges to steal our GitHub repository and made it public without the consent of the other developers. This resulted in severe economic losses and caused significant harm to our work.  
The recent updates to the project were mainly carried out by [private] and [private], and [private] (naganohara-yoshino) has not been a key contributor to the project for a long time.  
On October 11, 2025, at 21:50, despite warnings from the community administrator, [private] (naganohara-yoshino) left work without authorization and refused to fulfill the obligation to destroy confidential files for the association, instead maliciously publicly disclosing the development database.
