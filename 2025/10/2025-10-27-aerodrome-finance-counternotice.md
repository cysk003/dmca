Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and authorized representative of Aborean Finance, which developed and operates the Aborean protocol.

The repositories in question — aborean-contracts and aborean-slipstream — were created and published by our [private] based on Aerodrome’s open-source codebase, which was licensed under the Business Source License 1.1 with a Change License of GNU General Public License v2.0 or later (GPLv2+), effective June 1, 2025, as explicitly stated in the LICENSE.md file of the version we forked.

The BSL itself provides:

“This License applies separately for each version of the Licensed Work and the Change Date may vary for each version of the Licensed Work released by Licensor.”

Accordingly, the version we used transitioned to GPL independently, and its license terms cannot be retroactively modified by subsequent repository changes or metadata corrections.

The Slipstream repository in particular contains only GPL-compliant code.  
Several files that were previously labeled BUSL-1.1 incorporate upstream GPL libraries (e.g., [private], [private], [private]), which make the combined work GPL by operation of law under GPL §5(c) and §10.  
No active BUSL-licensed files remain in our version.

All Aborean repositories preserve the original licensing headers, notices, and full corresponding source as required under GPLv3, and contain no active BUSL-licensed code.  
Our publication and deployment were made in good faith under the open-source terms that governed the version we forked.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Entire repositories were removed:

https://github.com/Aborean-Finance/aborean-contracts  
https://github.com/Aborean-Finance/aborean-slipstream

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The takedown appears to result from a misidentification of the applicable license version and effective Change Date for the code in question.

Specifically:  
• The versions we used transitioned to GPLv2+ on June 1 2025, pursuant to their own license terms.  
• The BSL expressly prohibits retroactive restriction or alteration of a version’s Change Date.  
• Our repositories contain only GPL-compliant code, including upstream GPL components (e.g., [private], [private], [private], etc.).  
• All original notices, attributions, and build instructions are preserved in full, consistent with GPLv3 §§1, 5, and 6.

Therefore, our publication and use of this code were legally authorized and fully compliant with the open-source license that applied to that version.
I have a good-faith belief that the takedown was made in error due to misidentification of the applicable license version and date.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
