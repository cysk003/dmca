**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I handle [private] matters at Stanford University through its [private] and am authorized to act on behalf of the University in the takedown process of copyrighted material owned by Stanford.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
I apologize if my wording caused confusion. We have double-checked the files, and the infringing repository has been accurately represented. The material contained is 100% copyrighted intellectual property of the Stanford [private]. There is no partial work of any student in any of the materials (all handwritten annotations on some slides are by course staff from lectures given, not by any students, and the solution set files are the official ones prepared by the [private] department). We would appreciate if these materials were taken down as soon as possible. Thank you for your assistance.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/snoitallicso/math-51/blob/1d995f5aa299427cb37d7466ca3cd2c90b810a3a/math-51-book.pdf (this version of textbook has the Stanford [private] copyright at the bottom of every page after the first few pages).  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/snoitallicso/math-51  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Stanford University has a firewall ID system ([private]) that is required to access the material during the course. The course material is also labeled with copyright notices (Copyright (c) 2018 Stanford University Department of [private]. All rights reserved.) which state that sharing or uploading to websites is prohibited  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The offending poster took the materials from someone who was an actual student in the course at that time.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
