GitHub  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am an [private] (employee) of the sole copyright owner JetBrains s.r.o.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion, DataGrip, etc. are JetBrains s.r.o. proprietary desktop software products.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
The originals of the products can be found at JetBrains s.r.o. official website: https://jetbrains.com  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/thanhdevapp/jetbrains-reset-trial-evaluation-mac  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
JetBrains tools are protected with the two mechanisms: an activation code that can be downloaded legitimately from account.jetbrains.com website only, and a user credentials checked against the users database at this web service.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The repositories in question provide methods of avoiding or modifying the original JetBrains software/activation in order to obtain unauthorized access to the copyrighted work. Such methods include but are not limited to modification of the software in order to (i) prolong a trial period indefinitely; (ii) disable online verification with simultaneous unauthorized offline activation; (iii) access un-authorized 3rd party license server; etc.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
