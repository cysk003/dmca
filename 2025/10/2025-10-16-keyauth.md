If you are submitting this notice on behalf of a company, please be sure to use an email address on the company's domain. If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the KeyAuth authentication system and all related source code, including examples projects and SDKS. All original repositories were authored by [private] and are published under the Elastic License 2.0 on [private] [private] account at [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a proprietary authentication system called KeyAuth, which includes source code, APIs, client libraries, and example integrations in multiple programming languages.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://keyauth.cc  
https://keyauth.win  
https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Source-Code

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/byte2mov/codecave-hook

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] employ encryption, obfuscation, signature and hash checks to prevent attackers from compromising the integrity of [private] software as well as state the terms in the terms and conditions.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project functions as an explicit circumvention device that defeats the technological protection measures (TPMs) used by KeyAuth to control access to licensed software and services. Its source code and UI are not merely descriptive: they provide actionable code and user-facing controls that locate, hook, patch, and neutralize the authentication/validation routines that enforce our access controls.

Concrete operational behavior demonstrated in this repository:

The UI explicitly includes options labeled “Bypass Keyauth”, “Hook Keyauth Login”, “Scan Memory for Keyauth Download”, and memory NOP/patch controls (see codecave/menu/Menu.h). Example:  
https://github.com/byte2mov/codecave-hook/blob/main/codecave/menu/Menu.h

The repository contains hook/patch implementation files that target authentication functions and perform runtime modifications to validation logic,   including code to attach hooks, perform memory writes/NOPs, and manipulate control flow (see keyauthhook.h, hooks.cpp, memory.hpp). Examples:   
https://github.com/byte2mov/codecave-hook/blob/main/codecave/hooks/keyauthhook.h  
https://github.com/byte2mov/codecave-hook/blob/main/codecave/hooks/hooks.cpp  
https://github.com/byte2mov/codecave-hook/blob/main/codecave/hooks/memory.hpp

The README documents and advertises bypass features (e.g., “Keyauth Bypass Via nopping success method RVA”, built-in KeyAuth download finder, URLDownloadA/patch/dumper capabilities), which instructs users how to use the provided code to defeat our protections:  
https://github.com/byte2mov/codecave-hook/blob/main/README.md

How these behaviors circumvent our TPMs:

The code locates and modifies authentication/verification routines in-memory (patching/NOPing instructions or detouring execution) so that the normal license/auth checks are skipped or forced to succeed.

It installs hooks on KeyAuth-related API calls (hooking login/validation functions), allowing the attacker to intercept, alter, or suppress validation responses.

It provides tooling to find, dump, or replace protected binaries and to download/execute payloads, enabling unauthorized access to or misuse of protected software/services.

Legal basis (DMCA §1201):

Under 17 U.S.C. § 1201, devices, services, or code that are designed to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work are covered by the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions. The repository’s code and instructions operate as such a circumvention device because they are designed to bypass KeyAuth’s protection and thereby enable unauthorized access.
