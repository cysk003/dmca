**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Microsoft Corporation is the exclusive owner of all rights, title, and interest in and to Minecraft. This includes all associated source code, binaries, assets, and related intellectual property protected under copyright and trademark law.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

We hereby notify you on behalf of Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") that the following GitHub repository (the "Infringing URL") is hosting software designed and distributed primarily to circumvent the technological measures that effectively control access to and protect the copyrights of Microsoft's MINECRAFT software:

https://github.com/OpenM-Project/reMCenters

This repository contains reMCenters, an edited copy and successor of the unauthorized "M Centers" tool, explicitly used to crack the Minecraft Bedrock Edition for Windows.

I. Identification of the Copyrighted Work and Technological Measures   
Copyrighted Work: The copyrighted work is the MINECRAFT: Bedrock Edition software, including the proprietary software code, game assets, and the unique expression of its content, which is owned by Microsoft Corporation (Mojang AB).

Technological Protection Measures (TPMs): Minecraft Bedrock Edition for Windows is protected by various technological measures, including:

Proprietary Encryption/Obfuscation: Code obfuscation and proprietary security checks within the executable to prevent unauthorized access and modification.

Digital Rights Management (DRM): Licensing and authentication checks performed by the application and associated services to verify a user has a valid paid license to run the software.

II. Description of the Infringement (DMCA §1201 Violation)  
The Infringing URL hosts the reMCenters software, which is a derivative work and updated version of a prior tool (M Centers). Its primary purpose remains to circumvent the technological protection measures (DRM) described above, enabling users to improperly access, use, and modify the paid, copyrighted Minecraft Bedrock Edition software without a valid license (i.e., "cracking").

The fact that the original app may be discontinued does not mitigate the legal violation of hosting and distributing this current project. This conduct constitutes a violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (a)(2) by manufacturing and distributing technology primarily designed for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under Title 17.

Examples of the infringing content within this repository include, but are not limited to:

Circumvention Code Base: The core source code or binary files of reMCenters contain the proprietary logic, offsets, and memory manipulation techniques inherited from the original "M Centers" tool, all designed to bypass Minecraft's security checks.

Unauthorized Functionality Injection: Code designed to inject a DLL or similar module into the Minecraft process to gain unauthorized control over the copyrighted software's functions, bypassing licensing checks and enabling unauthorized features.

Proprietary Offset Data: Inclusion of specific memory addresses or data offsets related to the proprietary Minecraft executable, which are necessary to target and disable the game's official licensing and security verification routines.

III. Statutory Requirements  
We represent the following under penalty of perjury, in compliance with 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3):

Good Faith Belief: We have a good faith belief that the material described above is an unauthorized technology designed to circumvent technological measures, and its use is not authorized by the copyright owner (Microsoft Corporation), its agent, or the law.

Accuracy: We represent that the information in this notification is accurate.

Authorization: We are authorized to act on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, the owner of the copyright and intellectual property rights involved.

IV. Request for Action  
We request that you immediately disable public access to and remove or suspend the Infringing URL listed above, as it hosts software that is designed to violate Microsoft's exclusive rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by circumventing access and protection measures.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
