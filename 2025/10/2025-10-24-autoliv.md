I am an [private] at Autoliv which is an automative safety company headquartered in [private]. It was brought to my notice that some of the proprietary development work we have been working with our Customer has been posted on GitHub without authorization. We are seeking urgent help to restrict the public visibility of this github repo at the earliest. We do not know who has posted the content but our internal investigation is underway.  
The offending account is https://github.com/anapopescu-beep  
There are 3 public repositories listed: sandbox-daimler, audi_sandbox, geely_sandbox   
This is not an infringing of a public fork. It is our internal development code that is proprietary that is posted unauthorized  
Please note that Autoliv is also a Github enterprise customer.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The code and documentation shared has work we have been engaged on with our customer [private]. It includes details of the project planning and also contains some signing keys data. This is not authorized by anyone at Autoliv to post publicly and we need help to atleast make the repository private at a minimum. We do not know who operates this github account.   
The offending account is https://github.com/anapopescu-beep  
There are 3 public repositories listed: sandbox-daimler, audi_sandbox, geely_sandbox

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

This is internal development from Autoliv. We do not have it posted publicly.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The code is saved into an [private] [private] in a product called [private] [private]. We have access restricted to the developers who are involved. But we cannot prevent them from downloading if they need to work on it

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

At the moment the investigation as to how this was leaked and posted is underway

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/anapopescu-beep/sandbox-daimler  
https://github.com/anapopescu-beep/audi_sandbox

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No...at the moment we dont know. The account is under a name called [private]. This is the equivalent of a John Doe or Jane Doe. So its been created for obscurity

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
