DMCA Takedown Notice  
1. Copyright Ownership   
I am authorized to act on behalf of the Hotels Licensing Board (HLB), a [private] Government agency, in matters related to copyright and trademark enforcement.

2. Original Work  
The original copyrighted work is the official Hotels Licensing Board website, available at:  
https://www.hlb.gov.sg/

This includes:

Website layout and navigation structure (“Application Guidelines,” “Apply for Licence,” “Change of Hotel-Keeper,” etc.).

Headings, guides, and forms (e.g., “Guide for New Application for Licence”).

Footer attribution (“© [private] Government”) and official notices.

Government policy/support sections (“Who We Are,” “Privacy Statement,” “Terms of Use”).

3. Infringing Content  
The infringing repository is:  
https://github.com/fchew88/isomerpages-hlb

The entire repository is infringing.

Associated GitHub Pages site:  
https://fchew88.github.io/isomerpages-hlb/

4. Technological Measures Circumvented  
The official HLB website is hosted under the .gov.sg domain, which is restricted to government agencies. Publishing access is limited to authorized personnel.
The infringing repository circumvents these protections by copying and hosting the content outside official infrastructure, misleading users into believing it is an official government resource.

5. Requested Action  
I request removal of the infringing repository and all forks replicating the same infringing content.

6. Good Faith Statement  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
I have considered fair use.

7. Accuracy Statement  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
