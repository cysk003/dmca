**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Blue Archive employs several Technical Protection Measures (TPM) to safeguard its integrity and protect against unauthorized access and manipulation. These measures include:  
  
1. Debugger Detection: To prevent tools like [private] from monitoring and manipulating the application's runtime state, Blue Archive includes mechanisms to detect debuggers. This helps maintain the application's integrity and prevent malicious actions.  
  
2. Emulator Detection: Blue Archive has features to detect if the application is running within an emulator. Emulators replicate the hardware and software environment of a mobile device, allowing attackers to analyze and manipulate the app's behavior. By detecting emulators, the application can prevent execution in such environments​​.  
  
3. Method Hooking Prevention: Method hooking allows malicious users to intercept and alter specific function calls within the application. Blue Archive includes security mechanisms to detect and prevent such hooking attempts, ensuring that the application's code execution remains secure and unaltered​.  
  
4. Integrity Check: Blue Archive performs integrity checks to detect any tampering with its code. This helps prevent the insertion of malicious code or unauthorized modifications to the application.  
  
5. Network Security: To protect against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, Blue Archive uses encrypted communication and robust server authentication. This ensures that data transmitted between the user and the server remains secure and cannot be intercepted or altered by attackers​​.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The project’s stated mode of operation is to load an external DLL into the address space of the official Blue Archive client. Injection into the live client process circumvents protections that rely on the client binary remaining unmodified on disk, because it modifies behavior at runtime without altering the on-disk files.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.
