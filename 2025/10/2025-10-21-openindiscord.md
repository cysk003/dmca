I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I don't have an issue with the use of the project in particular but the fact that it is being included in compiled binary format without a copyright notice. [private] have messaged the owner per email and did not receive a response therefore [private] merely wish for github to remove the binary artifact that contains the compiled code.

It is a Safari extension used by several of [private] projects, not licensed under OSS License but available on GitHub as Projects that use it are also open source.
