No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the code in question.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is code [private] wrote as part of Programming Assignments and Projects [private] administered in a university course [private] taught. The user who I am alleging violated copyright was only given permission to use that code within the course while they were a student, and posting the code publicly is a copyright violation (this policy was made clear in the course agreement the user explicitly agreed to while taking [private] course). I am claiming that the entire directories listed below (not just individual files, but the entire directories) are infringing upon the original work I identified in the previous section of the notice. All of the code files in each of the listed repositories are derivatives of closed-source code for which [private] own the copyright. Specifically, students in [private] class are given closed-source starter code (for which [private] [private] own the copyright as the [private] [private]), and they make small modifications to the starter code files to solve the homework assignments. None of the files in any of the listed repositories are the student's completely original work: they are all derivatives of [private] copyright closed-source starter code, and as such, cannot be released with an open source license.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/danielburstein/Compression

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Students are only able to access [private] copyrighted material if they are enrolled in [private] course, and the code is only made available within the LMS environment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The student copied the code from the LMS environment and uploaded to their GitHub repos.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
