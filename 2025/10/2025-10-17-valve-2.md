1. I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
   
  
2. Half-Life 2 Beta 2003 source code.   https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/ . In 2003, Valve’s internal network was cracked, resulting in the leak of Half-Life 2’s source code onto the web. Valve allows the content to be used on Valve-sanctioned sites (such as Garry’s Mod) as long as it is distributed for free as a mod and does not use the original source code.  
   
  
3. https://github.com/barspinoff/BarsTech_goldsrc_compatible_public.  This includes unauthorized source code.  
   
  
Engine/voice_record_dsound.cpp and engine/circularbuffer.cpp are identical to the Half-Life 2 Beta 2003 leaked source code and have all the comments in that repo:  
  
e.g.:  
  
engine/circularbuffer.cpp  
  
[private]  
  
voice_record_dsound.cpp  
  
[private]  
  
Furthermore, the repository in question is an amalgam of the Half-Life 1 SDK, the Quake GPL release, and the leaked code from Half-Life 2 Beta 2003 leak.  The Half-Life 1 SDK and Quake GPL source release are not compatible in terms of licensing, due to the infectious nature of the GPL.  
  
   
  
4. Because the unauthorized code is mixed throughout and the licenses are not compatible, we ask that the entire repository and the associated forks be removed from GitHub.  The forks can be found here:
