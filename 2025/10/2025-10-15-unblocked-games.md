The infringing website is using the website code and graphics, the same as the original website. Most clearly is on the graphic content, but it's also on the website code as this is an older version of our website. It's very clear to look at the logo to see the same art, but also on the images that are all the same as freezenova website.  
  
website code:  
https://github.com/freezeenova/freezeenova.github.io/blob/main/index.html  
view-source:https://unblocked-games.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html  
The 2 are very similar. The infringing website is using an older version of our code.  
Additionally, all images on the infringing website are stolen from our website:  
infringing image: https://freezeenova.github.io/media/website/unblocked-games-freezenova-logo.webp  
original image: https://unblocked-games.s3.amazonaws.com/media/website/unblocked-games-freezenova-logo.webp  
infringing image: https://freezeenova.github.io/media/posts/510/responsive/drift-king-sm.webp  
original image: https://unblocked-games.s3.amazonaws.com/media/posts/510/responsive/drift-king-sm.webp  
and the list goes on with all their images.  
The infringing website is a scrape of freezenova website. Copyright is applied for both code and graphics. As it's a clear clone, this is clearly an infringing website.  
Additionally, we also have trademark on "FreezeNova". But DMCA has to be enough to take down the website.  
For trademark:  
USPTO Registration Number: [private]    
USPTO Serial Number: [private]
