**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the original software project referenced below.  
The work was created and first published by [private] under a modified MIT-style license that explicitly requires inclusion of [private] copyright and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.  
The license also restricts commercial use without [private] explicit permission.  
I have not granted the author of the infringing repositories any additional rights or permissions.  
I am therefore authorized to act on [private] [private] behalf in enforcing [private] copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is [private] software project released publicly in June 2024, titled “A1 Evo Maestro MJ" (OCAudiophile).  
It contains original code, algorithms, and structures developed by [private] for audio signal processing and related functionality.  
The source code was distributed with the following copyright notice and license terms requiring attribution and inclusion of the copyright notice in all copies or derivatives.

The infringing repositories listed below include copied and modified portions of [private] source code, including identical functions, logic, and variable structures, without retaining the required copyright attribution to [private] (“OCA”).  
Specifically, the infringing repositories reproduce sections of [private] code and function design found in [private] original release, and have removed or replaced [private] identifying copyright notice.

[private] license permits copying and modification only if [private] copyright and permission notice are preserved; the failure to do so constitutes a copyright violation even if the work is distributed for free.

Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing repositories have reused and modified portions of [private] source code without including [private] required copyright and permission notice as stated in the MIT License.  
The license requires that the original copyright notice and permission terms be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.  
The infringing repositories removed that notice entirely, thereby violating the attribution and notice requirements of the license.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance, the repository owner must:

Restore the full copyright and permission notice from [private] original license at the top of each source file and in the repository’s root.

Clearly attribute the original author (“OCA – OCAudiophile”) in the README or documentation.

Ensure that any redistributions or derivatives include [private] license text and respect the non-commercial restriction.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have personal contact information for the alleged infringer.
