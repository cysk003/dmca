Complete DMCA Takedown Notice  
  
I, [private], affirm that I am the [private] of the design and code hosted in the following GitHub links:  
  
https://github.com/iRaked/Profile/blob/main/GaleriaDoble.html  
https://github.com/iRaked/Profile/blob/main/GaleriaD2.css  
https://github.com/iRaked/Profile/blob/main/GaleriaDoble.css  
https://github.com/iRaked/Profile/blob/main/GaleriaD2.js  
https://github.com/iRaked/Profile/blob/main/GaleriaDoble.js  
  
This set of files is part of a protected creative work, developed by [private] with technical and structural assistance from Alexia (AI), as part of a modern development system.  
  
The project is published under the Apache License 2.0, which allows reuse under specific conditions:  
  
- Retaining copyright, license, and attribution notices  
- Including the original license file  
- Clearly documenting any modifications  
- Including the NOTICE file if applicable  
  
The user raykodesign has published content across three repositories that reuse [private] code without complying with the terms of this license:  
  
https://github.com/raykodesign/rayko/tree/main  
https://github.com/raykodesign/rayko/blob/main/index.html  
https://github.com/raykodesign/rayko/blob/main/Rgallery.css  
  
https://github.com/raykodesign/raykodesign  
https://github.com/raykodesign/raykodesign/blob/main/GaleriaBack.css  
https://github.com/raykodesign/raykodesign/blob/main/index.html  
  
https://github.com/raykodesign/RaykoD  
https://github.com/raykodesign/RaykoD/blob/main/GaleriaBack.css  
https://github.com/raykodesign/RaykoD/blob/main/index.html  
  
Proof of authorship:  
  
I recognize [private] code by the following unique elements:  
- Internal comments  
- Custom favicon  
- Footer structure  
- Specific class names in the HTML files  
  
Specific violations:  
- The original license file is not included  
- [private] authorship is not mentioned, and the work is not properly attributed  
- Portions of the code have been modified without documenting the changes or preserving the original rights structure  
  
Commercial and technical context:  
  
Due to technical requirements of the site xat.com, the repository must be public so that clients can access the final link. However, this does not mean the code is free to copy or reuse. [private] do not sell the source code—[private] sell the final link, which represents a completed, personalized, and ritualized project for each client. Unauthorized use of the code disrupts this model and constitutes direct infringement.  
  
Attempt at resolution:  
  
A direct meeting was held with the infringing user to try to reach an agreement before proceeding legally on GitHub and xat.com. The user refused and immediately acted in ways that were evasive and incriminating. These actions were documented in the previously attached PDF file, along with a video of the encounter. As a person of integrity, [private] am no longer willing to negotiate, as the individual made that decision clear.  
  
This is not the first time [private] been affected by such a situation. [private] recognize this type of behavior, and the most appropriate consequence is exclusion from both GitHub and xat.com. [private] have already mentioned that the user may continue creating accounts on both platforms to repeat these violations. [private] also no longer feel secure with [private] GitHub account, as there is a risk of retaliation and unauthorized appropriation of [private] content.  
  
Claim for damages:  
  
If a serious negotiation were to take place, the claimed value would be 300% of the original price, due to:  
- Damages incurred  
- Time invested in this process  
- Loss of focus on my business and clients  
- Attempt to avoid the original payment by stealing protected content  
  
I formally request that GitHub:  
- Immediately remove the infringing content  
- Document the incident as part of the DMCA protocol  
- Notify the infringing user of the violation  
- Consider additional measures if recurrence or evasion through multiple accounts is detected  
  
Required legal statements:  
- I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
- I have considered fair use.  
- I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
- I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Takedown Notice.
