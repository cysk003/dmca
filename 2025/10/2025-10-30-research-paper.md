**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the research, publications, and related materials collectively known as The 23 Laws of Marketing: Master Them or Die and The Machiavellian Framework (MMF). These works are officially published under [private] pen and [private] ([private]) and registered with DOIs across multiple academic repositories ([private], [private], [private], and [private]). I have not granted permission for redistribution, modification, or use of this material on GitHub or any other platform.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The infringing repository titled "HadrianStone-23-Laws-Marketing-Research by the user phavison (URL: https://github.com/phavison/HadrianStone-23-Laws-Marketing-Research) reproduces and/or modifies [private] copyrighted academic research and titles without authorization. The repository contains:

- Direct copies of [private] published papers including The Machiavellian Turn in Marketing Strategy, The Psychology of Scarcity in Modern Marketing, and The Machiavellian Marketing Framework (MMF).  
- Identical or nearly identical filenames, descriptions, and README text referencing [private] works and academic themes.  
- Use of [private] "[private]" in the repository title, falsely implying authorship and affiliation.  
- Steps on how to download an "application" with an executable. No such "[private]" app exists. Potentially a malicious malware link. Potentially using [private] to spread it.

This repository misleads the public, infringes upon [private] copyright, and reproduces protected content that is already officially registered and timestamped through DOI-certified academic platforms.
