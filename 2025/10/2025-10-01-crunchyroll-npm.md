To GitHub DMCA Agent,

We, IP Arrow LLC, are duly authorized to act on behalf of Crunchyroll, LLC, the exclusive owner of copyright-protected source code and related software used to operate the Crunchyroll streaming service. This notice is submitted pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. §512.

The repositories identified below contain source code, libraries, and modules copied or derived from Crunchyroll’s proprietary codebase without authorization. Specifically, they reproduce functions, APIs, and modules that are part of Crunchyroll’s internal systems for:

Device integration (e.g., Roku support, Appium drivers).

Content delivery and playback.

User authentication and account/session management.

API endpoints and client-server communication protocols.

This code is proprietary to Crunchyroll and is not licensed for public distribution or modification. By reproducing and publishing this code, the repository owner is infringing Crunchyroll’s exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

The infringing repositories include (non-exhaustive):

https://github.com/dlenroc/appium-roku-driver

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dlenroc/binary-decoder  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dlenroc/vitest-serenity-js  
For example:  

In node-roku, the repository contains files such as lib/device.js and lib/transport.js which reproduce functions and command structures taken directly from Crunchyroll’s proprietary Roku integration code.

In appium-roku-driver, the lib/driver.js file contains routines and APIs that replicate Crunchyroll’s protected automation and playback testing modules.

In binary-decoder.js, the repository reproduces Crunchyroll’s binary parsing logic, which is an internal utility owned by Crunchyroll.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing repositories is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
