To whom it may concern,

I represent Andrews McMeel Universal, the host and operator of https://www.thefarside.com/ and the authorized agent of the copyrighted The Far Side works published on that platform.

It has come to our attention that a website for which you are listed as the host, listed below for reference, has been scraping content from TheFarSide.com and has copied, reposted, and redistributed the proprietary material of our represented creators, without authorization: 

https://github.com/sphars/rss-feeds  
https://sphars.github.io/rss-feeds/feeds/the_far_side/feed.xml

The infringing works consist of links to our The Far Side comic strips, images, and related content originally published on our platform. The original material may be found here:

https://www.thefarside.com/ 

The use of these works by the operator of the infringing site has not been authorized by Andrews McMeel Universal or its affiliate FarWorks, Inc. As such, this constitutes a clear violation of our rights under 17 U.S.C. ยง 106.

Given the foregoing facts, we request that you immediately remove the reported webpage and let us know once it has been taken down. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

I have taken fair use into consideration.  
Under penalty of perjury, I am an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
This notification is accurate.
