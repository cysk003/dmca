**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] have set the repository as [private] on [private], which restricts access only to authorized collaborators. No one outside of the allowed list can view, clone, or fork the repository. This effectively controls access to the copyrighted content and prevents unauthorized use or distribution.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The alleged project has been designed in a way that directly copies or reproduces the contents of [private] [private] [private], which contains proprietary technology, scripts, and configurations. Despite the original repository being private and access-controlled, the alleged project replicates the structure, algorithms, and source code without authorization. This constitutes an intentional circumvention of the technological measures [private] have applied to protect [private] copyrighted work. The project effectively bypasses the access restrictions and reproduces protected content, thereby violating [private] copyright.

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
