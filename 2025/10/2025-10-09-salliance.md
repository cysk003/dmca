I am writing to bring to your attention a repeat and deliberate copyright infringement by the same individual, [private]. As the [private] of the company holding full rights and complete ownership of the original code, I must report that [private] has once again posted our proprietary source code on GitHub under a newly created account.

Importantly, this new infringing directory was created around the same time as the previous infringing directory that was already removed by GitHub under our original DMCA takedown. This clearly demonstrates that [private] had no intention of correcting his actions or complying with GitHub‚Äôs DMCA process. Instead, he deliberately created multiple repositories to continue distributing our company‚Äôs proprietary materials.

For your reference, I am including the original DMCA takedown notice, along with details of the newly infringing directory in this submission.

At this time, we respectfully request that you:

Remove this newly identified infringing directory associated with [private]‚Äôs account.  
Suspend or permanently ban this user, as this represents a repeat and premeditated violation.  
While I understand the challenge of monitoring multiple new usernames, we kindly request that GitHub consider implementing additional checks or verification measures to prevent this individual from repeatedly posting our code under new accounts. His actions are intentional, deceptive, and harmful to our company, and they undermine the integrity of your platform.

 

DMCA takedown form submitted earlier:

-----

Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.

 

I am the [private] and [private] of SAlliance, the company that owns all intellectual property related to the SAlliance App 2025 project. This proprietary software and all associated source code, design elements, and architecture were developed by interns and team members working under legally binding Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) that explicitly prohibit retaining, copying, or sharing any portion of the project ‚Äî including ideas, designs, or code ‚Äî during or after the internship.

 

The infringing party ([private]) was an intern whose account was suspended due to misconduct. We gave him the opportunity to correct his behavior and continue, but he chose to resign instead. Despite all legal agreements, he has since published SAlliance's proprietary code publicly on GitHub without authorization.

 

As the copyright  and [private], I have full authority to act on behalf of SAlliance in this matter and to submit this DMCA takedown notice to protect our intellectual property.
