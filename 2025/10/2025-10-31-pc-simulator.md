**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf? If you are submitting this notice on behalf of a company, please be sure to use an email address on the company's domain. If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder. 

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the video game “PC Simulator”, including all source code, assets, sound effects, textures, and 3D models. [private] published this work as an Android APK on Google Play. I have not authorized anyone to publish or modify the source code or assets of this game.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is [private] game PC Simulator, which is publicly available on the Google Play Store and App Store. This work includes proprietary game code written in C# and compiled using Unity. The game’s internal class names, file structure, and logic flow are original creative works developed by [private].

The infringing repository on GitHub, titled "PC-Simulator-Source-code", contains code that was decompiled from [private] compiled binaries.  
It reproduces [private] original class names, file organization, and logic structure, which clearly originate from [private] proprietary code.  
The uploader has combined [private] decompiled code with their own additions and published it publicly without authorization.

This does not qualify as fair use:  
It is not transformative, as it reuses [private] game’s structure and identifiers instead of creating commentary or educational content.  
It does not serve critique, research, or parody, but merely republishes and modifies [private] work.  
It affects [private] market by allowing others to copy or clone [private] game, harming [private] ability to monetize and protect it.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

[private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/ImNotDario-new/PC-Simulator-Source-code-CSharp

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The game is distributed exclusively as a compiled Android APK through the Google Play Store. The original source code, sound effects, textures, and 3D models are stored in Unity’s proprietary build format, which is not directly accessible to end users. This compilation process, combined with the APK packaging, prevents public access to the original source code and assets.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub project was created by decompiling [private] game binaries, thereby bypassing the technological measure that prevents access to the original source code.  
This reverse-engineering and redistribution of decompiled source constitutes a circumvention of access controls under the DMCA.

The repository therefore both:  
Circumvents the technical barrier (decompilation of compiled binaries), and  
Publishes the resulting derivative code publicly without permission.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
