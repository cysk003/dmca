To Whom It May Concern:

We hereby notify you on behalf of Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) that the content hosted on your platform infringes upon Microsoft’s copyrights, specifically those protecting the MINECRAFT game and its associated proprietary code. Microsoft is the exclusive owner of the intellectual property rights, goodwill, and reputation associated with MINECRAFT, which is copyrighted under United States and other applicable laws. The official source for information on MINECRAFT is located at https://www.minecraft.net/.

1. Identification of the Copyrighted Work  
The copyrighted work infringed upon is the proprietary MINECRAFT game code and assets (Java Edition and Bedrock Edition), which is exclusively owned by Microsoft/Mojang AB. This includes the proprietary structure, logic, and code that is protected by technological measures of encryption and obfuscation.

2. Identification of the Infringing Material and Circumvention Claims  
The following repository URLs, hosted on your platform, contain material that directly infringes upon the MINECRAFT copyright and/or are designed to circumvent Microsoft's technological protection measures (TPMs), which effectively control access to the copyrighted material:

Infringing URL: https://github.com/ChasePixel/mcp-reborn

Infringement Description: This repository contains and distributes proprietary, de-obfuscated, and reverse-engineered Minecraft source code files. This is a derivative work and direct reproduction of the copyrighted game code (Claim under 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3)).

Infringing URL: [private]

Infringement Description: This repository contains code designed to bypass or connect to proprietary servers without standard client/server verification (e.g., login or license checks), potentially facilitating unauthorized access to or use of the copyrighted game software/services (Claim under 17 U.S.C. §1201(a)(2)).

Infringing URL: [private]

Infringement Description: The explicit purpose of this mod is to bypass a technological measure (server filtering/blocking) implemented by Microsoft/Mojang to control access to the multiplayer game environment. This violates the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA (Claim under 17 U.S.C. §1201(a)(2)).

Circumvention of Technological Protection Measures (TPMs): The TPMs effectively controlling access to the copyrighted Minecraft software and services include (1) the proprietary obfuscation/encryption of the Java code, and (2) the proprietary server connection protocols and filtering logic. The materials listed above are designed to circumvent or defeat these measures.
