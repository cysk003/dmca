I am the [private] [private] of namefix-cpp (previously 'namefix') hosted on https://github.com/sukulent/namefix-cpp (previously https://github.com/sukulent/namefix) written in C++.  
[private] came up with the idea [private] and created it on [private] [private] as a project for my university C++ course, without any knowledge of the namefix.pl project written in Perl and hosted on [private] and on [private]. The first time I have seen the project is after I have received the DMCA notice to which this is a counter notice.

I believe in good faith that the notice was filed due to misidentification, as I could not have infringed upon the namefix.pl project, as I did not know about its existence.

Separately, I understand the namespace collision issue. To eliminate possible confusion between the projects and as a goodwill gesture, I have changed the name to namefix-cpp.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
