All intellectual property rights in this code are owned by MyCarWash Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The proprietary software code of MyCarWash Inc is stored in a [private] [private] [private], which restricts access to only authorized company personnel. Access requires a [private] account with explicit permissions granted by the repository owner. These access controls effectively prevent unauthorized users from viewing, copying, or distributing the code.

Despite these measures, [private], a former [private] who was terminated, currently has unauthorized access, which constitutes infringement. No other individuals or third parties have authorization to access or use this code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repository ([private]) makes our proprietary code available outside our private access controls. MyCarWash’s code was stored in a [private] [private] restricted to authorized company accounts; the accused project has published the same code in a repository accessible outside those protections. In effect the accused project circumvents our technological measures by (a) hosting the proprietary code in an externally accessible repository and/or (b) using credentials or an account controlled by a terminated former partner ([private]) to publish or mirror the private code. This has allowed the code to be viewed and downloaded despite our private-repo access controls.
