Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of all frontend and design code for the website "[private]".  
[private] [private] developed the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and full UI/UX design of the [private] website, which was hosted on [private] [private] and [private].   
The complainant (“[private]”) only worked on the Java software backend and was never involved in the website’s creation or ownership.   
He explicitly acknowledged [private] work on [private], asking [private] to "push" [private] own code to his repository and approving [private] designs ("Looks pretty smexy" / "Final this").  
These conversations clearly show that [private] [private] the legitimate creator of the web project.  
Additionally, the complainant later gained unauthorized access to my VPS and deleted my files, as he admitted publicly (“I already nuked his VPS”).
He has no right to file a DMCA for code that was never created or licensed by him.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The DMCA claim was filed in bad faith.  
The complainant was never the creator or owner of the website code that was taken down.  
He only managed the Java-based backend project and has no rights over the frontend or the modified backend parts [private] created.  
All files on [private] GitHub repository were [private] own original work.  
The complainant’s claim falsely identifies [private] web design and code as his property while admitting elsewhere to malicious actions (such as deleting [private] [private] and seizing [private] domain).  
This takedown request was an abuse of the DMCA process meant to suppress [private] legitimate work.  
I request that GitHub reinstates my repository immediately.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
