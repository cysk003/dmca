**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/abhishekya233/k8s-overcommit-operator  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
apache-license-2.0  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
To comply with the Apache License 2.0, it is essential to preserve existing copyright notices and clearly state any changes made in redistributed or derivative works.  
  
In this case, the modifications to the README create the impression that the repository owner is the original author of the project. There is no indication that this is a redistribution of our code, which misrepresents the original authorship.  
  
Moreover, several files were removed without the required disclosure, as shown in https://github.com/abhishekya233/k8s-overcommit-operator/commit/60a51f16571a02ef7d85fc82bf3d84b9f0a52707 , a change that should have been documented in a NOTICE file under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License.  
  
In addition, it appears that the repository is being used to artificially boost its visibility by performing repeated push events that only modify the README file every few hours, as seen in this activity feed [private]. This behavior undermines the integrity of the open-source ecosystem and misleads users searching for the legitimate project.  
  
We also noticed that all communication channels have been disabled by blocking issues and removing visible contact information, making it impossible to address this matter directly.  
  
We strongly support and encourage responsible open-source collaboration (after all, a little contact info never hurt anyone.): acknowledge original authors, document your modifications, and choose naming practices that respect the community and avoid confusion.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
In our view, the ideal approach to comply with the Apache License 2.0 would be to create a fork, which would transparently show the origin of the project, if that option is not possible, the repository owner must properly attribute our team, for example, by including a statement such as:  
“Original code from Inditex Tech K8s-overcommit-operator (Apache 2.0)”.  
  
We acknowledge that this repository has been modified, as several files have been removed. Under the Apache 2.0 License, such modifications must be clearly documented, ideally in a NOTICE file or within the project documentation. Once the changes are properly attributed and documented, we would consider this a derivative work, which could then be distributed under a new license if desired.  
  
However, if the goal is simply to redistribute the original project, without significant functional changes, then the original Apache 2.0 License must be preserved.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
No. All contact information has been hidden or disabled.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
