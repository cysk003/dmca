**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Blue Archive APK employs several Technical Protection Measures (TPM) to safeguard its integrity and protect against unauthorized access and manipulation. These measures include:  
  
1. Debugger Detection: To prevent tools like Frida from monitoring and manipulating the application's runtime state, Blue Archive includes mechanisms to detect debuggers. This helps maintain the application's integrity and prevent malicious actions.  
  
2. Emulator Detection: Blue Archive has features to detect if the application is running within an emulator. Emulators replicate the hardware and software environment of a mobile device, allowing attackers to analyze and manipulate the app's behavior. By detecting emulators, the application can prevent execution in such environments​​.  
  
3. Method Hooking Prevention: Method hooking allows malicious users to intercept and alter specific function calls within the application. Blue Archive includes security mechanisms to detect and prevent such hooking attempts, ensuring that the application's code execution remains secure and unaltered​.  
  
4. App Integrity Check: Blue Archive performs integrity checks to detect any tampering with its code. This helps prevent the insertion of malicious code or unauthorized modifications to the application.  
  
5. Network Security: To protect against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, Blue Archive uses encrypted communication and robust server authentication. This ensures that data transmitted between the user and the server remains secure and cannot be intercepted or altered by attackers​​.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
Previously, I submitted a DMCA notice that identified a repository and specific files under the GitHub user [private] which included [private]-based scripts and source code used to bypass technical protection measures and to redirect traffic from official NEXON [private] servers to unauthorized private servers. Those URLs (hosted under [private]) have since been removed by GitHub and are no longer reachable.  
  
However, despite removal of the original [private] URLs, copies, forks, and other repositories remain active and continue to distribute or enable:  
  
- Source code files that utilize Frida to manipulate and redirect network traffic from NEXON [private]’s official servers to unauthorized private servers. Example of previously-observed file (now removed):  
- [private] (deleted)  
  
*[private] is an open-source dynamic instrumentation toolkit that allows users to inject scripts into running applications for the purposes of analysis, debugging, and modification. It is commonly used by security researchers and reverse engineers to interact with and manipulate software in real-time.  
  
- Scripts and documentation describing how to modify NEXON [private]’s Blue Archive application to bypass authentication and other security measures (previously referenced in the removed repository).  
  
- Unauthorized distribution or reproduction of portions of the official application source (previously observed under SCHALE.Common/FlatData and SCHALE.Common/Crypto in the removed repo). Example (deleted):  
[private] (deleted)  
[private] (deleted)  
  
These actions not only constitute unauthorized use of NEXON [private]'s intellectual property but also breach the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as they involve circumventing NEXON [private]'s software protection mechanisms.
