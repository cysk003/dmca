Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
  
No  
  
**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
We are the legitimate owners of the customized whitelabel application "dev-halomajstore-web". We purchased the base whitelabel application from a vendor and have extensively customized it for over a year. Our company, SmartSolutions, holds the copyright to this customized version of the software.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work is our proprietary web application, "dev-halomajstore-web", which is a highly customized whitelabel solution. This application is hosted on our development server at [private] and managed through our private [private] repository. Our contact email for this project is [private].  
  
The infringing repository, "Tristan-Alvarez-Dev/dev-halomajstore-web" on GitHub, is an IDENTICAL and unauthorized copy of our private [private] project. It contains our specific customizations, including commits made by "SmartSolutions" in August 2025.  
  
Furthermore, the infringing repository publicly exposes highly sensitive and private credentials from our README.md file, including:  
- Our SSH password: [private]  
- All four of our admin passwords  
- Our company password: [private]  
- Our server details: [private]  
- Our email: [private]  
- A [private] link with access credentials.  
  
The account "Tristan-Alvarez-Dev" was created only 5 days ago, which strongly suggests a recent and deliberate act of theft. The presence of backdated commits (2019-2022) by "[private]" and "[private]" is suspicious and appears to be an attempt to legitimize the stolen code. We cannot verify the authenticity of these older commits.  
  
This is a direct theft of our customized project, posing a severe security risk due to the public exposure of our critical infrastructure credentials.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
Our original work is hosted in a private [private] repository. We can provide access to GitHub support upon request for verification.  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/Tristan-Alvarez-Dev/dev-halomajstore-web  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
No  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Reported content must be removed  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
We are requesting GitHub's assistance in identifying the source of this copyright infringement to pursue appropriate legal action. Specifically, we need:  
  
1. IP addresses used for commits by "[private]" and "[private]" (2019-2022)  
2. Email addresses associated with these commits  
3. Geographic location data for these commits  
4. Actual timestamps of when these commits were made (not backdated dates)  
5. Any other technical information that could help identify the individuals responsible  
  
This information is crucial for our legal investigation because:  
  
- We need to determine if "[private]" and "[private]" are legitimate developers from our vendor  
- We need to identify if this is theft by a competitor, former employee, or unauthorized third party  
- We need to determine whether to pursue legal action against:  
* Our vendor's developers (if they leaked the code)  
* A competitor who stole our customized version  
* An unauthorized third party who gained access to our private repository  
  
Without this information, we cannot determine the appropriate legal course of action. We are prepared to provide legal documentation and work with law enforcement if necessary.  
  
Please provide this information to help us identify the source of the theft and pursue appropriate legal remedies.
